# 1. Background
Woola Woola is an existing small business entity founded by Jean Tan, a friend of mine. It is an accessorized earrings store, which currently has social media presence as its only channel of marketing, communication and business transaction. As a strategic planning for future expansion, Woola Woola requires a website to showcase its business and products, and subsequently, a platform for communication and an online store. Due to the process of learning, the website will not be able to support the communication platform and online store at the moment.

# 2. Objectives
* To complete Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Front-End Development.
* To showcase Woola Woola as a business entity.
